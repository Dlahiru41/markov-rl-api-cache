# markov-rl-api-cache

Markov Chain-based Reinforcement Learning framework for adaptive API caching in microservices.

This repository contains components for:
- Markov chain modeling of API call patterns
- Reinforcement learning agents (DQN) to adapt cache policies
- Simulators for microservice traffic and failures
- Integration with API gateway and cache backends (Redis)
- Evaluation, baselines, and monitoring setups

See the `src/`, `simulator/`, and `evaluation/` directories for implementation and experiment code.
